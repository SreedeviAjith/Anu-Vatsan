      <p>Anusha Vatsan who is known to her friends as Anu is a self-made Entrepreneur who has worked hard on her own to make herself known as an aspiring dress designer in London and Greater London. Her interest in stitching has been from an early age where she has seen her mother making tailored blouses and ethnic Indian wear in Coimbatore, India. </p>



      <p>Anu was keen on making dresses for her own little daughter and thatâ€™s when the idea of starting her own boutique took shape. She slowly made her clientele in designing childrenâ€™s clothes with her known friendsâ€™ circle and now through word of mouth and exhibiting her works in cultural events has paved way for bigger opportunities. </p>



      <p>Anu lives in Kent and specialises more on exclusive ethnic Indian wear ranging from Saree blouses, tops, kurtas and not to mention her love for kidsâ€™ party wear. Anu provides in-house tailoring services, where she offers all her customers not just off the shelf designs, but also a custom fit, tailored and alterable choices.</p>

      <p>In short, she is all about trendy Indo-Western wear, and mainly focuses on fit, comfort, flexibility, customization, and choice. Basically, Anuâ€™s Touch will be the one stop shop for all your fusion clothing brand with a touch of Indian essence ðŸ˜Š.</p>

      <p>Apart from her passion for designing, she is a loving mother, wife and a great friend. She enjoys many aspects of art right from music, painting, cooking, interior designing and love for movies.</p>
